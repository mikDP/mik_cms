## Requirements

To be able to run the project you will need: a local web server, PHP >= 5.5 and MySQL.
You will find the database backup in the root folder (**mik_cms.sql**) with few example records already in it.

## The Project


I started this project while I was working for a security company that needed to document a video surveillance software. 
The purpose of **mik_cms** is to offer a simple tool to generate documentation via a rich WYSIWYG editor and at the same time  to allow the developers to manage the user portal.
So **mik_cms** is composed by 3 modules. The firsts 2 modules are incorporated in the folder "mik_cms" and they are the modules that developers use to generate documentation (DCMS) and manage the user portal (WCMS).
The third module is the user portal itself, "mik_live" in which the content is dynamically managed by the firsts 2 modules.

## Documentation

I worked on this profect for my graduation thesis, so if you can read italian, you will find in **Documentazione - Tesi.docx** a good documentation for the the firsts 2 modules of the software (DCMS and WCMS modules).
